The "CPUProcessScheduler" code simulates a CPU process scheduling algorithm using different scheduler implementations in Python. It allows for the analysis and comparison of two scheduling algorithms: First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) and Shortest Process Next (SPN).

The code consists of several classes and functions. The "Process" class represents a process with an ID, arrival time, and a list of activities. The "Event" class represents an event in the simulation, indicating either an arrival or an unblock. The "EventQueue" class manages a queue of events, providing methods for pushing, popping, peeking, and checking if the queue is empty. The "SchedulerTemplate" class defines a template for different scheduler implementations, including FCFS and SPN, with methods for initialization, timeout, stopping a running process, handling arrivals, handling unblocks, and handling idle CPU time. The "FCFS_Scheduler" class implements the FCFS scheduling algorithm, while the "SPN_Scheduler" class implements the SPN scheduling algorithm. The "Sim" class encapsulates the simulation logic, including the clock, processes, events, running time, and the chosen scheduler implementation. It provides methods for running the simulation, handling time, processing events, and parsing process and scheduler files.

To use the code, ensure you have a "processes.txt" file containing the process details in the specified format. You can customize the processes and their activities in this file. The code will parse the process file, create the necessary process objects, and simulate the scheduling algorithms.

The code creates instances of the "Sim" class for FCFS and SPN schedulers, passing the parsed processes and the corresponding scheduler implementation as parameters. It then executes the simulation for each scheduler using the "run" method of the "Sim" class. Finally, it prints a message indicating the completion of the simulation.

By running the "CPUProcessScheduler" code, you can observe the behavior and performance of different CPU process scheduling algorithms, such as FCFS and SPN, in a simulated environment. It allows for the evaluation and comparison of these algorithms in terms of turnaround time, waiting time, and overall efficiency.
